  <h2>1.0 Introduction</h2>
  <p>This Privacy Notice is related to Rush Consulting Ltd with registered address Suite 1, Sterling Building Enrico Mizzi Street
    Ta'Xbiex, XBX 1453, Malta, namely, Rush Consulting Ltd,(‘Company’, ‘we’, ‘us’, ‘our’). We are committed to safeguarding the privacy of our clients using our services (‘user’, or ‘you’, ‘your’). The Company has a separate Privacy Policy for the usage of its website, namely, www.rushconsultingltd.com.
    This Privacy Notice explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard and treat your personal information when you are seeking to become a client, and/or you are a client of Rush Consulting Ltd, whether through an ongoing business relationship or an occasional transaction (collectively, ‘Services’). 
    By utilising, or receiving, our services, you agree with the terms of this Privacy Notice. By providing us with your personal information, you acknowledge to the Company processing your personal data/personal information in accordance with this Notice and the applicable EU laws and regulations.</p>
  <h2>2.0 What type of personal information will we hold on you and why?
</h2>
<p>We may collect, store and use the following kinds of personal information:
    <ol>
        <li>Personal details as per our ‘Know Your Customer’ (KYC) forms and/or through our centralised KYC Portal system. Details will include your name, surname, address, identification details, date of birth, the service we are providing you, citizenship, nationality and similar information about you.</li>
        <li>We will keep a copy of your identification document(s) such as ID card, driving license, residency card, passport or any other identification document available to fulfil our obligations under the 4th and 5th AML Directives.</li>
        <li>We will keep a copy of information or documentation to proof residency of your address such as bank statement, bank reference, utility bill, fix telephone line bill, lease agreement or similar documentation. This is to fulfil our obligations in line with the 4th and 5th AML Directives.</li>
        <li>We will keep a copy of name checks, google searches and passport checks on you. Such ‘name screening’ is performed to prevent fraud, money laundering, sanctions, funding of terrorism, financial crime or any other type of crime. This is also in line with the 4th and 5th AML Directives and/or internal risk-based policy of the Group. Such screening services are performed when the relationship with the client or prospect has initiated and on an ongoing basis apply a risk-based approach.</li>
        <li>We will keep a copy of your communication with us, such as emails and letters, in line with our legal obligations under the 4th and 5th AML Directives or due to a legitimate interest.</li>
        <li>We may process and hold information about your wealth, such as the value of your assets; details of bank accounts, inheritance information and similar related information to your global net worth. We shall use such information in line with our AML/CFT obligations.</li>
        <li>We shall process and hold certain declarations that we may ask you to provide, mostly referred to as ‘Client Onboarding Questionnaire’, in line with our legal obligations. The name of the questionnaire may differ depending on different circumstances and professional positions you may hold in relation to our client.</li>
        <li>We may hold and process any other information or documentation we provide to you to complete, whether in physical or digital format, in line with our legal obligations and/or internal risk-based approach policy.</li>
        <li>We may also ask for a copy of your employment contract as a supporting documentation on your source of wealth or funds, on a risk-sensitive basis. Other employment data may also be processed if these provide any value in terms of ML/FT risk mitigation.</li>
    </ol>
</p>
<h2>3.0 When do we need your consent?</h2>
<p>
 We shall need your consent in the following circumstances:
<ol>
    <li>When sending you direct marketing material or promotions regarding our services, unless there is a clear and tested legitimate interest for you to receive such material;</li>
    <li>When sharing your personal information outside the Group, unless we are required to do so by law such as providing information to police, court of law or a competent authority, or when we are sending your data to date processors in order to be able to provide you with a service. Please see section 5 for more details. We may also share your data outside the group without your consent if we are sharing it with our processors to help us provide you with a service; and</li>
    <li>When processing your personal information without having one of the other legal basis found in section 4 below.</li>
</ol>
Please note that you can withdraw your consent at any time, unless there is another legal basis that allows us to process your data as per the below section.
</p>
<h3>3.1 Sending of non-marketing information</h3>
<p>From time to time we may send you non-marketing material such as general information about matters that may concern you. Such material is usually sent by email. This is performed after ensuring that our legitimate interest to send you such non-marketing material would not affect in a negative manner your privacy. We shall always provide you with an option to unsubscribe from such informative material. Should you unsubscribe, we shall not send you further non-marketing material. The same would apply if you have requested or shall request that no material whatsoever is sent to you.

    Examples of such non-marketing material are found below:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Information about tax incentives published by a Government;</li>
        <li>Information about new regulations;</li>
        <li>Information about your rights under any regulation or legislation;</li>
        <li>Information about an investment aid issued by a Government;</li>
        <li>Information about any other topic which may be of personal interest for you.</li>
        The above list is non-exhaustive.
    </ul>
    <h2>4.0 When can we process your personal data?</h2>
    <p>Apart from the ‘consent’ noted in section 3 above, we may also process your data if we have the following legal basis:
    <ol>
        <li>Contractual obligation or necessity;</li>
        <li>Legal obligation;</li>
        <li>Member-state law;</li>
        <li>Vital interest of the data subject;</li>
        <li>When processing the data is in the best interest of the public; and</li>
        <li>Legitimate interest.</li>
    </ol>
    It is the nature of our business to process your data mostly due to a contractual necessity, legal obligation or due to a legitimate interest. When neither of these apply, it is likely that we will process your data based upon your consent. That said, Rush Consulting Ltd may process data according to regulations listed within the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).
</p>
<h2>5.0 How and when do we disclose your personal information to third parties?

        <li>In all other circumstances where you would have given your consent.</li>
    </ol>

<ol>
    <li>Ensuring the data is safeguarded by the use of any of the following: firewalls, encryptions, access restrictions and/or passwords;</li>
    <li>In case of physical copies of your personal information or data, precaution shall be taken to ensure such data is accessible only to individuals within the Group that require to access your data to perform their duties and/or to provide you with a service;</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>7.0 For how long shall we keep your data?</h2>

<p>We shall destroy your data in a safe and reliable manner. Physical files shall be destroyed by means of shredding. Shredding services may be outsourced to third parties. Rush Consulting Ltd shall ensure that if shredding is outsourced to third parties, the Company shall review their data privacy procedures and safeguard the interest of the data subjects through ways and means such as through a contractual agreement between the Company as data controller and the shredding company as data processors in line with Article 28 of the General Data Protection Regulation. For the removal of any doubt, this would only apply if Rush Consulting Ltd provides non-shredded data to the shredding service provider. If shredding is done in-house, then the shredding service provider will not be considered as a data processor.

    In the case of data stored in digital format, such data shall be permanently deleted. This would include any backups held on servers and/or cloud.</p>
<p>Communication between the client and the Group shall be deleted or destroyed.
